Can Joshua go back to winning ways or will American Franklin cause a huge upset? Anthony Joshua has to not only beat Jermaine Franklin at the O2 Arena on Saturday, he has to win in style. A points win is not good enough. I want to see him get rid of Franklin early, stand in the ring and call out Tyson Fury. Fury-Joshua is still huge. A massive fight not just for British boxing but also on a global stage. A loss, and I think that's the end for Joshua. Where does he go from there? But I don't think that will happen. This is a fight where Joshua can get the confidence back a bit. After consecutive losses to Oleksandr Usyk, that's what the big man desperately needs.5 Live Boxing: Who is Jermaine Franklin?Now is the 'worst time' to fight me - Joshua5 Live Boxing: Analysing Joshua's last fightThe perfect comeback opponent for JoshuaBehind the scenes at Joshua's Texas training campThis is the perfect type of fight for Joshua to come back to - an opponent who is credible enough. I actually thought Franklin beat Dillian Whyte in his last fight, although he didn't get the decision.But in terms of a heavyweight boxer, he's got 22 fights with 14 knockouts. It's a nice ratio for a featherweight, but not necessarily for a heavyweight. Linking up with Derrick James and basing his training camp in Texas is a good move for Joshua, and perhaps one he should have done before now. Get away from the UK and from home comforts - have that camp mentality and not so many yes men around you.Joshua is also in a gym full of good champions, with the Charlo brothers, Jermell and Jermall, and Errol Spence Jr. It's probably the first time in AJ's career he's not been the top dog in the gym. He's got world champions there and it'll be good for him. He can feed off that.If you look at the style of the Charlos and Spence, they're quite aggressive fighters. That's the coaching style that Derrick James has and that's what we need to see from AJ again. AJ can turn back the clockWe want him to go back to the old AJ that we used to know. I'm not saying it was brute force and ignorance, but it was close to that. He's a big, big man and he just went and took people out. Dominated fights from the centre of the ring, going forward and being aggressive. AJ's not a boxer. He's not fleet-footed, he's a wrecking machine and he needs to get back to that.Can he turn back the clock? It's not going to be easy, but it's definitely possible. We've seen fighters suffer defeats in the heavyweight division that they weren't expected to lose and come back. Wladimir Klitschko - look how long he dominated the division after being knocked out by lesser opponents in Ross Puritty and Corrie Sanders. Even the great Lennox Lewis lost to Hasim Rahman and came back in the next fight. Fury and AJ can win back fansFury needs to fight me to redeem himself - JoshuaThe Fury-Usyk undisputed fight falling through could actually work out favourably for JoshuaFury's in a position now where a lot of people are blaming him for that fight not happening. A few months ago he was being lauded and is now facing a lot of criticism because of the antics and things he said around the proposed Usyk fight, and even previous to that. Imagine if Fury now faces another Dillian Whyte or Derek Chisora-type opponent, nobody want's to see that. I'm not saying a win against Franklin will automatically set up the Fury fight, but I would love to see a stern, clear call-out - 'I want Tyson Fury next'.Fury might also be in a position now where he feels like he has to take that fight. He may feel AJ is an easier fight than the Usyk fight, which quite possibly it is. I think it could all work in AJ's favour. It could also be a chance for both Britons to get people back on side as well.A loss will leave AJ with regrets Joshua being pushed to 'breaking point' in rebuildWe all saw Joshua's outburst in the ring after his loss to Usyk in Saudi Arabia last year. I'd say as soon as he did it he would have regretted it. He understands it wasn't a good look for him. But the amount of pressure that has been on that man's shoulders was insane. It's been there from the very start, from turning professional as an Olympic champion. People have their own opinion on Joshua but I have to say every time I've been around him he's always been so nice. I was doing a podcast and was in New York for the first Joshua v Andy Ruiz fight. There was press everywhere trying to get him. I approached the stage where I was hoping to get a few words with him and he pointed at me out of maybe 30 press that were around and told me to come round. He spoke to me for about 10 minutes, probably to the annoyance of the other press there. But that is something I will always appreciate. He's a great guy. He's someone who has taken criticism but when you are this superstar, people do like to see you knocked off the top perch.There's a different type of pressure on him now in that his career is over if he can't beat Franklin. A loss will leave him with many regrets. He will be thinking about those big fights - against the likes of Fury or Deontay Wilder - which never happened.

3,,,"Premier League clubs avoided Â£250m in tax, expert estimate",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65097761,"Premier League clubs avoided Â£250m in tax, expert estimatePublished13 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Ben Chu and Mike CowanBBC NewsnightPremier League football clubs may have avoided paying Â£250m in tax over a three-year period, financial experts have estimated.It follows analysis looking at how football agents are often paid to represent both players and clubs in negotiations, including transfers.Tax Policy Associates, which led the analysis, says the practice reduces the amount of tax paid on agent payments.HM Revenue and Customs said it was investigating ""a number of clubs"".We do not know which clubs are being investigated, but the teams thought to have benefitted most from dual representation in the past few years include Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. The clubs all declined to comment.Dual representationWhen footballers move clubs or negotiate a new contract, an agent represents the player involved and seeks the best terms for his or her client.The agent will then receive a fee, or commission, and the whole transaction will incur tax, including income tax, National Insurance and VAT.However, tax officials are investigating the use of so-called ""dual representation contracts"", which sees an agent paid for acting for both the player and the club involved in the deal.The process is complicated - but when half of the agent's fee is paid by the club, it means that half of the payment avoids tax.The Tax Policy Associates think tank has estimated the practice is potentially worth tens of millions of pounds a year.If the agent's fee is picked up solely by the player, it says HMRC can expect to receive around 60% of the total payment in tax.However, the amount of tax due falls to about 30% of the payment, if the fee is split between the player and the club using dual representation. Use of the practice has become standard in the sport, with some top flight clubs using it in all of their deals. In 2021, FA data revealed around 68% of Premier League player deals were done through dual representation.Image source, Getty ImagesTax Policy Associates estimates the practice may have saved top players, their agents and their acquiring clubs Â£81m in 2019, Â£91m in 2020 and Â£81m in 2021 - more than Â£250m over the three years.In 2021, Tax Policy Associates estimates Manchester City saved Â£10.9m in tax, followed by Manchester United with Â£10m and Liverpool with Â£8.1m. In 2020, the largest beneficiary was Chelsea, saving Â£12.8m.All its estimates are based on the assumption that player and club split the agent fee 50:50. In theory, the FA has rules against an agent acting for both the player and the club. But if all parties provide written consent to use dual representation, the practice is technically allowed. However, Labour MP Meg Hillier, chair of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said she will urge HMRC to look into the Premier League's use of dual representation.  ""Guidance that's a bit weak isn't really good enough,"" she said. ""You need to have a real clarity about exactly what the position is so that every club does the same thing. You can't have one club doing it and getting away with it and another not.""Â£7.6bn economy boostIn April 2021, HMRC issued fresh guidance on the use of dual representation which said it would need clubs to keep evidence that agents are legitimately working for both sides of the contract. It said fees should not automatically be split 50:50, and should instead reflect the extent the agent represented the club and the player.HMRC could issue penalties and demands for repayments if it finds that an agent has not legitimately been working for both the player and the club when brokering transfer deals.But the Association of Football Agents (AFA) said it disputed the think tank's findings, saying there was a ""fundamental misunderstanding of how the football transfer market works"". It said: ""The AFA's members will continue to work closely with HMRC to ensure that the law and current guidance is followed in the structuring of arrangements with tax consequences, as they always have.""An HMRC spokesperson added: ""Dual representation cannot be assumed to be a tax avoidance scheme; its use can be tax compliant. ""However, we carefully scrutinise arrangements between clubs and employees, and we work closely with the football industry to educate and deal with tax risk head on. ""Our actions and the money bought in from this industry speak for themselves. Since 2015, from across all tax areas in the football industry, we've recovered Â£573m that would otherwise have gone unpaid.""BBC Newsnight approached individual clubs, but each declined to comment. A Premier League spokesperson said: ""We believe that the overall figure suggested here is based on assumptions that do not recognise the individual circumstances of each transaction. ""During the 2019/2020 season Premier League football contributed Â£7.6bn to the UK economy. In the same season the Premier League and its clubs generated a total tax contribution of Â£3.6bn to the UK Exchequer, Â£1.4bn of which was accounted for by Premier League players.""Related TopicsTax avoidanceHM Revenue & Customs"

He took charge of Saudi Arabia in July 2019 and guided them to their second successive World Cup finals, where they shocked eventual champions Argentina in a 2-1 win in Qatar last year.Renard has never managed a women's team and takes charge of a France side ranked fifth in the world.They are seeking to win their first World Cup this summer and the French Football Federation (FFF) will now hope for a return of the players who boycotted the national team under Diacre.France captain Wendie Renard said last month she will not play at the World Cup and criticised her country's football ""system"".The Lyon centre-back was joined in doing so by team-mates Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto, with forward Diani saying the management of the team was the reason behind her decision. In announcing Diacre's exit, the FFF said the situation had become ""irreversible"".SAFF president Yasser Al-Misehal confirmed earlier this week: ""[Renard] has an offer from the French Federation and expressed his desire to take this opportunity.""We were informed four days before the current international window and I received a letter from the French Federation, and consulted with the board of directors and we decided to accept this request.""Following Saudi Arabia's 2-1 friendly loss to Bolivia on Tuesday, Renard said: ""I would like to thank everybody in Saudi for their support during almost four years. ""I think I did the maximum with the team. I can't reach another level so I prefer to be honest with everybody. Thank you again, it was a fantastic time.""Renard will announce his first squad for France's upcoming April friendlies against Colombia and Canada during his presentation on Friday.Who is Lord Sugar's newest business partner?: Watch the nail-biting final of The ApprenticeIs paying more for premium petrol worth it?: Greg Foot drives the investigation into the fumy world of petrol"
6,,,Australian Grand Prix: Sergio Perez says he has Red Bull's backing to challenge Max Verstappen,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/65121697,"Verstappen won the first race of the season with Perez second before the positions were reversed in the second weekendAustralian Grand PrixDate: Friday 31 March-Sunday 2 April Venue: Albert Park, MelbourneCoverage: Live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, plus text commentary, news, reports and analysis on BBC Sport website & app Sergio Perez says he ""fully believes"" that he has Red Bull's backing to challenge Max Verstappen for the world championship this year.The Red Bull drivers have one win each this year and Verstappen leads Perez in the championship by just a point ahead of Sunday's Australian Grand Prix.""When I first came to the team, things were very different,"" said Perez, who joined for the start of 2021.""Basically, they were just going racing with two cars because they had to.""It will take 'a long time' to close gap on Red Bull - HamiltonHow to follow the Australian Grand Prix on the BBCThe 33-year-old added: ""I can now say that I really feel part of the team, have my place and am well respected.""I really believe I have the team's full support, as much as Max does, and that I will have every opportunity to win the championship, as much as Max.""Red Bull are perceived as Verstappen's team and in the past Perez has been used as a back-up driver to aid the Dutchman's cause.But following their dominant start to the season, Red Bull have found themselves essentially unchallenged and Perez is determined to use the opportunity to make his first bid for the F1 title.That approach is likely to lead to tensions with Verstappen but Perez says he believes the two men will be able to handle any difficulties that emerge.""I'm here to do the best possible thing for myself as well,"" he said. ""To be honest, we have a lot more respect for each other than people might think. Inside the team, there is a very high level of respect with each other. ""I think we are both mature enough to know what's right and what's wrong and, as long as that keeps being the case, I don't expect anything to change.""The potential for conflict between the two was made clear during the last race in Saudi Arabia, when Verstappen insisted on going for the point for fastest lap when his engineer had said the team was ""not concerned about that"".Perez admitted on Thursday at the start of the Australian Grand Prix weekend that he believed in Jeddah that he was not free to go for fastest lap but insisted that it was ""a bit of miscommunication between my engineer and myself - I don't think there was any more to it. I think the team did a good job to let us race"". However, his comments in Melbourne reflected an inconsistency of messaging at Red Bull. Team principal Christian Horner said after the race in Saudi Arabia that Perez had also tried to go for fastest lap on the final tour of the race but had made a mistake at the first corner and had to abandon the attempt.But Perez said: ""No, I didn't try. I spoke with my engineers and it was all clear. I had a word with Christian after the race and it was all clear. ""It's nothing big. You guys like to create some stories when we're not racing but I think it's all good in the team.""He added: ""I probably regret not having a go at the fastest lap because I thought that was the case. ""But the communication that they'd told me something and told something different to Max… it was just down to us to go out there and do it.""Last year, Perez also started the season strongly, only for the development direction of Red Bull's car - particularly the team's desire to reduce its weight and make its characteristics suit Verstappen's driving preferences - to leave Perez struggling for pace.The Mexican said he believed that would not be the case this year.""Certainly last year when we started developing the car - or basically when we put the car on a diet - that suited Max more,"" Perez said. ""I believe at the moment we are asking for the same things. In the first two races, we've been very close together on (car) balance and asking for similar sort of balance. In that regard, it's probably good for now.""Verstappen reveals effect of illness Verstappen admitted on Thursday that an illness he had in the break between the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian races had affected his performance in Jeddah more than he admitted at the time.""I refused to believe it myself for a long time because at home I was really ill and could barely walk around,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I felt like I was missing a lung. I got to the weekend really believing it was gone because normally when you get sick, two or three days afterwards you're alright, you can just do your work.""But then when I jumped in the car in FP1, even with just one performance lap I felt like I had to recover for two laps to be able to breathe normally.""It definitely affected me throughout the weekend. But this weekend it should be alright.""Pre-season testing schedule & 2023 car launches"
7,,,Arsenal: How Gunners delivered on potential in Champions League,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65120035,"Jonas Eidevall has ended Arsenal's 10-year-wait to reach the Champions League last fourIt was not that long ago that Arsenal were being written off as contenders this season after suffering an injury crisis.What a difference a few weeks make; now they are firmly in the hunt to win three trophies.A stunning first-half display against Bayern Munich on Wednesday saw them overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit and book their place in the Women's Champions League semi-finals for the first time in a decade.It caps an impressive month for the Gunners, who ended a four-year wait for silverware by beating Chelsea in the League Cup final on 5 March.""It's been a long-term goal of mine to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League,"" said manager Jonas Eidevall. ""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect. It doesn't mean it's easy and we can do every time, but if we have that potential wouldn't it be incredible and beautiful to bring that to this competition too?""Football Daily podcast reflecting on Arsenal's Champions League winBuoyed by their north London derby victory over Tottenham at the weekend, Eidevall's side were purring with intensity at the Emirates and blew Bayern away with two brilliantly worked goals.They can now look forward to a European semi-final - and with just a three-point gap to WSL leaders Manchester United with seven games remaining, winning three trophies is not out of the question.""Process is really important and results create belief,"" said Eidevall. ""It means the things you are doing, you are more inclined to do again when you win football matches from it.""This month has given us [the results] and hopefully that creates a lot of belief as well.""Emirates 'a realistic vision' as our homeArsenal manager Jonas Eidevall savoured the victory with his players on the pitchVictory gave Eidevall and his players a ""special"" moment in front of more than 20,000 fans - a record crowd for a women's European game played in England.It was a performance the Swede described as their best game at the larger stadium during his time at the club.""It was special when I came here and we beat Chelsea 3-2 in my first game but that was limited time we had worked here,"" said Eidevall. ""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident. They were unbelievable and thoroughly deserved the win. They won't fear whoever is next.""Who is Lord Sugar's newest business partner?

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

9,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"
10,,,"Yulduz and Fariba Hashimi: Escaping the Taliban, chasing a dream",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/63403027,"Yulduz Hashimi (left), Fariba Hashimi (centre) and fellow Afghan Zehra Rezayee on the podium after the Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan 2022It's a scorching hot June afternoon in the middle of an Italian heatwave. There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."

12,,,"Premier League clubs avoided Â£250m in tax, expert estimate",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65097761,"Premier League clubs avoided Â£250m in tax, expert estimatePublished13 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Ben Chu and Mike CowanBBC NewsnightPremier League football clubs may have avoided paying Â£250m in tax over a three-year period, financial experts have estimated.It follows analysis looking at how football agents are often paid to represent both players and clubs in negotiations, including transfers.Tax Policy Associates, which led the analysis, says the practice reduces the amount of tax paid on agent payments.HM Revenue and Customs said it was investigating ""a number of clubs"".We do not know which clubs are being investigated, but the teams thought to have benefitted most from dual representation in the past few years include Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. The clubs all declined to comment.Dual representationWhen footballers move clubs or negotiate a new contract, an agent represents the player involved and seeks the best terms for his or her client.The agent will then receive a fee, or commission, and the whole transaction will incur tax, including income tax, National Insurance and VAT.However, tax officials are investigating the use of so-called ""dual representation contracts"", which sees an agent paid for acting for both the player and the club involved in the deal.The process is complicated - but when half of the agent's fee is paid by the club, it means that half of the payment avoids tax.The Tax Policy Associates think tank has estimated the practice is potentially worth tens of millions of pounds a year.If the agent's fee is picked up solely by the player, it says HMRC can expect to receive around 60% of the total payment in tax.However, the amount of tax due falls to about 30% of the payment, if the fee is split between the player and the club using dual representation. Use of the practice has become standard in the sport, with some top flight clubs using it in all of their deals. In 2021, FA data revealed around 68% of Premier League player deals were done through dual representation.Image source, Getty ImagesTax Policy Associates estimates the practice may have saved top players, their agents and their acquiring clubs Â£81m in 2019, Â£91m in 2020 and Â£81m in 2021 - more than Â£250m over the three years.In 2021, Tax Policy Associates estimates Manchester City saved Â£10.9m in tax, followed by Manchester United with Â£10m and Liverpool with Â£8.1m. In 2020, the largest beneficiary was Chelsea, saving Â£12.8m.All its estimates are based on the assumption that player and club split the agent fee 50:50. In theory, the FA has rules against an agent acting for both the player and the club. But if all parties provide written consent to use dual representation, the practice is technically allowed. However, Labour MP Meg Hillier, chair of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said she will urge HMRC to look into the Premier League's use of dual representation.  ""Guidance that's a bit weak isn't really good enough,"" she said. ""You need to have a real clarity about exactly what the position is so that every club does the same thing. You can't have one club doing it and getting away with it and another not.""Â£7.6bn economy boostIn April 2021, HMRC issued fresh guidance on the use of dual representation which said it would need clubs to keep evidence that agents are legitimately working for both sides of the contract. It said fees should not automatically be split 50:50, and should instead reflect the extent the agent represented the club and the player.HMRC could issue penalties and demands for repayments if it finds that an agent has not legitimately been working for both the player and the club when brokering transfer deals.But the Association of Football Agents (AFA) said it disputed the think tank's findings, saying there was a ""fundamental misunderstanding of how the football transfer market works"". It said: ""The AFA's members will continue to work closely with HMRC to ensure that the law and current guidance is followed in the structuring of arrangements with tax consequences, as they always have.""An HMRC spokesperson added: ""Dual representation cannot be assumed to be a tax avoidance scheme; its use can be tax compliant. ""However, we carefully scrutinise arrangements between clubs and employees, and we work closely with the football industry to educate and deal with tax risk head on. ""Our actions and the money bought in from this industry speak for themselves. Since 2015, from across all tax areas in the football industry, we've recovered Â£573m that would otherwise have gone unpaid.""BBC Newsnight approached individual clubs, but each declined to comment. A Premier League spokesperson said: ""We believe that the overall figure suggested here is based on assumptions that do not recognise the individual circumstances of each transaction. ""During the 2019/2020 season Premier League football contributed Â£7.6bn to the UK economy. In the same season the Premier League and its clubs generated a total tax contribution of Â£3.6bn to the UK Exchequer, Â£1.4bn of which was accounted for by Premier League players.""Related TopicsTax avoidanceHM Revenue & Customs"

He took charge of Saudi Arabia in July 2019 and guided them to their second successive World Cup finals, where they shocked eventual champions Argentina in a 2-1 win in Qatar last year.Renard has never managed a women's team and takes charge of a France side ranked fifth in the world.They are seeking to win their first World Cup this summer and the French Football Federation (FFF) will now hope for a return of the players who boycotted the national team under Diacre.France captain Wendie Renard said last month she will not play at the World Cup and criticised her country's football ""system"".The Lyon centre-back was joined in doing so by team-mates Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto, with forward Diani saying the management of the team was the reason behind her decision. In announcing Diacre's exit, the FFF said the situation had become ""irreversible"".SAFF president Yasser Al-Misehal confirmed earlier this week: ""[Renard] has an offer from the French Federation and expressed his desire to take this opportunity.""We were informed four days before the current international window and I received a letter from the French Federation, and consulted with the board of directors and we decided to accept this request.""Following Saudi Arabia's 2-1 friendly loss to Bolivia on Tuesday, Renard said: ""I would like to thank everybody in Saudi for their support during almost four years.

""To be honest, we have a lot more respect for each other than people might think. Inside the team, there is a very high level of respect with each other. ""I think we are both mature enough to know what's right and what's wrong and, as long as that keeps being the case, I don't expect anything to change.""The potential for conflict between the two was made clear during the last race in Saudi Arabia, when Verstappen insisted on going for the point for fastest lap when his engineer had said the team was ""not concerned about that"".Perez admitted on Thursday at the start of the Australian Grand Prix weekend that he believed in Jeddah that he was not free to go for fastest lap but insisted that it was ""a bit of miscommunication between my engineer and myself - I don't think there was any more to it. I think the team did a good job to let us race"". However, his comments in Melbourne reflected an inconsistency of messaging at Red Bull. Team principal Christian Horner said after the race in Saudi Arabia that Perez had also tried to go for fastest lap on the final tour of the race but had made a mistake at the first corner and had to abandon the attempt.But Perez said: ""No, I didn't try. I spoke with my engineers and it was all clear. I had a word with Christian after the race and it was all clear. ""It's nothing big. You guys like to create some stories when we're not racing but I think it's all good in the team.""He added: ""I probably regret not having a go at the fastest lap because I thought that was the case. ""But the communication that they'd told me something and told something different to Max… it was just down to us to go out there and do it.""Last year, Perez also started the season strongly, only for the development direction of Red Bull's car - particularly the team's desire to reduce its weight and make its characteristics suit Verstappen's driving preferences - to leave Perez struggling for pace.The Mexican said he believed that would not be the case this year.""Certainly last year when we started developing the car - or basically when we put the car on a diet - that suited Max more,"" Perez said. ""I believe at the moment we are asking for the same things. In the first two races, we've been very close together on (car) balance and asking for similar sort of balance. In that regard, it's probably good for now.""Verstappen reveals effect of illness Verstappen admitted on Thursday that an illness he had in the break between the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian races had affected his performance in Jeddah more than he admitted at the time.""I refused to believe it myself for a long time because at home I was really ill and could barely walk around,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I felt like I was missing a lung. I got to the weekend really believing it was gone because normally when you get sick, two or three days afterwards you're alright, you can just do your work.""But then when I jumped in the car in FP1, even with just one performance lap I felt like I had to recover for two laps to be able to breathe normally.""It definitely affected me throughout the weekend.

""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect.

""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident.

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"
19,,,"Yulduz and Fariba Hashimi: Escaping the Taliban, chasing a dream",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/63403027,"Yulduz Hashimi (left), Fariba Hashimi (centre) and fellow Afghan Zehra Rezayee on the podium after the Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan 2022It's a scorching hot June afternoon in the middle of an Italian heatwave. There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."

21,,,"Premier League clubs avoided Â£250m in tax, expert estimate",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65097761,"Premier League clubs avoided Â£250m in tax, expert estimatePublished13 hours agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesBy Ben Chu and Mike CowanBBC NewsnightPremier League football clubs may have avoided paying Â£250m in tax over a three-year period, financial experts have estimated.It follows analysis looking at how football agents are often paid to represent both players and clubs in negotiations, including transfers.Tax Policy Associates, which led the analysis, says the practice reduces the amount of tax paid on agent payments.HM Revenue and Customs said it was investigating ""a number of clubs"".We do not know which clubs are being investigated, but the teams thought to have benefitted most from dual representation in the past few years include Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. The clubs all declined to comment.Dual representationWhen footballers move clubs or negotiate a new contract, an agent represents the player involved and seeks the best terms for his or her client.The agent will then receive a fee, or commission, and the whole transaction will incur tax, including income tax, National Insurance and VAT.However, tax officials are investigating the use of so-called ""dual representation contracts"", which sees an agent paid for acting for both the player and the club involved in the deal.The process is complicated - but when half of the agent's fee is paid by the club, it means that half of the payment avoids tax.The Tax Policy Associates think tank has estimated the practice is potentially worth tens of millions of pounds a year.If the agent's fee is picked up solely by the player, it says HMRC can expect to receive around 60% of the total payment in tax.However, the amount of tax due falls to about 30% of the payment, if the fee is split between the player and the club using dual representation. Use of the practice has become standard in the sport, with some top flight clubs using it in all of their deals. In 2021, FA data revealed around 68% of Premier League player deals were done through dual representation.Image source, Getty ImagesTax Policy Associates estimates the practice may have saved top players, their agents and their acquiring clubs Â£81m in 2019, Â£91m in 2020 and Â£81m in 2021 - more than Â£250m over the three years.In 2021, Tax Policy Associates estimates Manchester City saved Â£10.9m in tax, followed by Manchester United with Â£10m and Liverpool with Â£8.1m. In 2020, the largest beneficiary was Chelsea, saving Â£12.8m.All its estimates are based on the assumption that player and club split the agent fee 50:50. In theory, the FA has rules against an agent acting for both the player and the club. But if all parties provide written consent to use dual representation, the practice is technically allowed. However, Labour MP Meg Hillier, chair of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said she will urge HMRC to look into the Premier League's use of dual representation.  ""Guidance that's a bit weak isn't really good enough,"" she said. ""You need to have a real clarity about exactly what the position is so that every club does the same thing. You can't have one club doing it and getting away with it and another not.""Â£7.6bn economy boostIn April 2021, HMRC issued fresh guidance on the use of dual representation which said it would need clubs to keep evidence that agents are legitimately working for both sides of the contract. It said fees should not automatically be split 50:50, and should instead reflect the extent the agent represented the club and the player.HMRC could issue penalties and demands for repayments if it finds that an agent has not legitimately been working for both the player and the club when brokering transfer deals.But the Association of Football Agents (AFA) said it disputed the think tank's findings, saying there was a ""fundamental misunderstanding of how the football transfer market works"". It said: ""The AFA's members will continue to work closely with HMRC to ensure that the law and current guidance is followed in the structuring of arrangements with tax consequences, as they always have.""An HMRC spokesperson added: ""Dual representation cannot be assumed to be a tax avoidance scheme; its use can be tax compliant. ""However, we carefully scrutinise arrangements between clubs and employees, and we work closely with the football industry to educate and deal with tax risk head on. ""Our actions and the money bought in from this industry speak for themselves. Since 2015, from across all tax areas in the football industry, we've recovered Â£573m that would otherwise have gone unpaid.""BBC Newsnight approached individual clubs, but each declined to comment. A Premier League spokesperson said: ""We believe that the overall figure suggested here is based on assumptions that do not recognise the individual circumstances of each transaction. ""During the 2019/2020 season Premier League football contributed Â£7.6bn to the UK economy. In the same season the Premier League and its clubs generated a total tax contribution of Â£3.6bn to the UK Exchequer, Â£1.4bn of which was accounted for by Premier League players.""Related TopicsTax avoidanceHM Revenue & Customs"

He took charge of Saudi Arabia in July 2019 and guided them to their second successive World Cup finals, where they shocked eventual champions Argentina in a 2-1 win in Qatar last year.Renard has never managed a women's team and takes charge of a France side ranked fifth in the world.They are seeking to win their first World Cup this summer and the French Football Federation (FFF) will now hope for a return of the players who boycotted the national team under Diacre.France captain Wendie Renard said last month she will not play at the World Cup and criticised her country's football ""system"".The Lyon centre-back was joined in doing so by team-mates Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto, with forward Diani saying the management of the team was the reason behind her decision.

""To be honest, we have a lot more respect for each other than people might think. Inside the team, there is a very high level of respect with each other. ""I think we are both mature enough to know what's right and what's wrong and, as long as that keeps being the case, I don't expect anything to change.""The potential for conflict between the two was made clear during the last race in Saudi Arabia, when Verstappen insisted on going for the point for fastest lap when his engineer had said the team was ""not concerned about that"".Perez admitted on Thursday at the start of the Australian Grand Prix weekend that he believed in Jeddah that he was not free to go for fastest lap but insisted that it was ""a bit of miscommunication between my engineer and myself - I don't think there was any more to it. I think the team did a good job to let us race"". However, his comments in Melbourne reflected an inconsistency of messaging at Red Bull. Team principal Christian Horner said after the race in Saudi Arabia that Perez had also tried to go for fastest lap on the final tour of the race but had made a mistake at the first corner and had to abandon the attempt.But Perez said: ""No, I didn't try. I spoke with my engineers and it was all clear. I had a word with Christian after the race and it was all clear. ""It's nothing big. You guys like to create some stories when we're not racing but I think it's all good in the team.""He added: ""I probably regret not having a go at the fastest lap because I thought that was the case. ""But the communication that they'd told me something and told something different to Max… it was just down to us to go out there and do it.""Last year, Perez also started the season strongly, only for the development direction of Red Bull's car - particularly the team's desire to reduce its weight and make its characteristics suit Verstappen's driving preferences - to leave Perez struggling for pace.The Mexican said he believed that would not be the case this year.""Certainly last year when we started developing the car - or basically when we put the car on a diet - that suited Max more,"" Perez said. ""I believe at the moment we are asking for the same things. In the first two races, we've been very close together on (car) balance and asking for similar sort of balance. In that regard, it's probably good for now.""Verstappen reveals effect of illness Verstappen admitted on Thursday that an illness he had in the break between the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian races had affected his performance in Jeddah more than he admitted at the time.""I refused to believe it myself for a long time because at home I was really ill and could barely walk around,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I felt like I was missing a lung. I got to the weekend really believing it was gone because normally when you get sick, two or three days afterwards you're alright, you can just do your work.""But then when I jumped in the car in FP1, even with just one performance lap I felt like I had to recover for two laps to be able to breathe normally.""It definitely affected me throughout the weekend. But this weekend it should be alright.""Pre-season testing schedule & 2023 car launches"
25,,,Arsenal: How Gunners delivered on potential in Champions League,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65120035,"Jonas Eidevall has ended Arsenal's 10-year-wait to reach the Champions League last fourIt was not that long ago that Arsenal were being written off as contenders this season after suffering an injury crisis.What a difference a few weeks make; now they are firmly in the hunt to win three trophies.A stunning first-half display against Bayern Munich on Wednesday saw them overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit and book their place in the Women's Champions League semi-finals for the first time in a decade.It caps an impressive month for the Gunners, who ended a four-year wait for silverware by beating Chelsea in the League Cup final on 5 March.""It's been a long-term goal of mine to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League,"" said manager Jonas Eidevall. ""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect. It doesn't mean it's easy and we can do every time, but if we have that potential wouldn't it be incredible and beautiful to bring that to this competition too?""Football Daily podcast reflecting on Arsenal's Champions League winBuoyed by their north London derby victory over Tottenham at the weekend, Eidevall's side were purring with intensity at the Emirates and blew Bayern away with two brilliantly worked goals.They can now look forward to a European semi-final - and with just a three-point gap to WSL leaders Manchester United with seven games remaining, winning three trophies is not out of the question.""Process is really important and results create belief,"" said Eidevall. ""It means the things you are doing, you are more inclined to do again when you win football matches from it.""This month has given us [the results] and hopefully that creates a lot of belief as well.""Emirates 'a realistic vision' as our homeArsenal manager Jonas Eidevall savoured the victory with his players on the pitchVictory gave Eidevall and his players a ""special"" moment in front of more than 20,000 fans - a record crowd for a women's European game played in England.It was a performance the Swede described as their best game at the larger stadium during his time at the club.""It was special when I came here and we beat Chelsea 3-2 in my first game but that was limited time we had worked here,"" said Eidevall. ""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident. They were unbelievable and thoroughly deserved the win. They won't fear whoever is next.""Who is Lord Sugar's newest business partner?

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

27,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"
28,,,"Yulduz and Fariba Hashimi: Escaping the Taliban, chasing a dream",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/63403027,"Yulduz Hashimi (left), Fariba Hashimi (centre) and fellow Afghan Zehra Rezayee on the podium after the Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan 2022It's a scorching hot June afternoon in the middle of an Italian heatwave. There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."

He took charge of Saudi Arabia in July 2019 and guided them to their second successive World Cup finals, where they shocked eventual champions Argentina in a 2-1 win in Qatar last year.Renard has never managed a women's team and takes charge of a France side ranked fifth in the world.They are seeking to win their first World Cup this summer and the French Football Federation (FFF) will now hope for a return of the players who boycotted the national team under Diacre.France captain Wendie Renard said last month she will not play at the World Cup and criticised her country's football ""system"".The Lyon centre-back was joined in doing so by team-mates Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto, with forward Diani saying the management of the team was the reason behind her decision. In announcing Diacre's exit, the FFF said the situation had become ""irreversible"".SAFF president Yasser Al-Misehal confirmed earlier this week: ""[Renard] has an offer from the French Federation and expressed his desire to take this opportunity.""We were informed four days before the current international window and I received a letter from the French Federation, and consulted with the board of directors and we decided to accept this request.""Following Saudi Arabia's 2-1 friendly loss to Bolivia on Tuesday, Renard said: ""I would like to thank everybody in Saudi for their support during almost four years. ""I think I did the maximum with the team. I can't reach another level so I prefer to be honest with everybody. Thank you again, it was a fantastic time.""Renard will announce his first squad for France's upcoming April friendlies against Colombia and Canada during his presentation on Friday.Who is Lord Sugar's newest business partner?: Watch the nail-biting final of The ApprenticeIs paying more for premium petrol worth it?: Greg Foot drives the investigation into the fumy world of petrol"
31,,,Australian Grand Prix: Sergio Perez says he has Red Bull's backing to challenge Max Verstappen,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/65121697,"Verstappen won the first race of the season with Perez second before the positions were reversed in the second weekendAustralian Grand PrixDate: Friday 31 March-Sunday 2 April Venue: Albert Park, MelbourneCoverage: Live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, plus text commentary, news, reports and analysis on BBC Sport website & app Sergio Perez says he ""fully believes"" that he has Red Bull's backing to challenge Max Verstappen for the world championship this year.The Red Bull drivers have one win each this year and Verstappen leads Perez in the championship by just a point ahead of Sunday's Australian Grand Prix.""When I first came to the team, things were very different,"" said Perez, who joined for the start of 2021.""Basically, they were just going racing with two cars because they had to.""It will take 'a long time' to close gap on Red Bull - HamiltonHow to follow the Australian Grand Prix on the BBCThe 33-year-old added: ""I can now say that I really feel part of the team, have my place and am well respected.""I really believe I have the team's full support, as much as Max does, and that I will have every opportunity to win the championship, as much as Max.""Red Bull are perceived as Verstappen's team and in the past Perez has been used as a back-up driver to aid the Dutchman's cause.But following their dominant start to the season, Red Bull have found themselves essentially unchallenged and Perez is determined to use the opportunity to make his first bid for the F1 title.That approach is likely to lead to tensions with Verstappen but Perez says he believes the two men will be able to handle any difficulties that emerge.""I'm here to do the best possible thing for myself as well,"" he said. ""To be honest, we have a lot more respect for each other than people might think. Inside the team, there is a very high level of respect with each other. ""I think we are both mature enough to know what's right and what's wrong and, as long as that keeps being the case, I don't expect anything to change.""The potential for conflict between the two was made clear during the last race in Saudi Arabia, when Verstappen insisted on going for the point for fastest lap when his engineer had said the team was ""not concerned about that"".Perez admitted on Thursday at the start of the Australian Grand Prix weekend that he believed in Jeddah that he was not free to go for fastest lap but insisted that it was ""a bit of miscommunication between my engineer and myself - I don't think there was any more to it. I think the team did a good job to let us race"". However, his comments in Melbourne reflected an inconsistency of messaging at Red Bull. Team principal Christian Horner said after the race in Saudi Arabia that Perez had also tried to go for fastest lap on the final tour of the race but had made a mistake at the first corner and had to abandon the attempt.But Perez said: ""No, I didn't try. I spoke with my engineers and it was all clear. I had a word with Christian after the race and it was all clear. ""It's nothing big. You guys like to create some stories when we're not racing but I think it's all good in the team.""He added: ""I probably regret not having a go at the fastest lap because I thought that was the case. ""But the communication that they'd told me something and told something different to Max… it was just down to us to go out there and do it.""Last year, Perez also started the season strongly, only for the development direction of Red Bull's car - particularly the team's desire to reduce its weight and make its characteristics suit Verstappen's driving preferences - to leave Perez struggling for pace.The Mexican said he believed that would not be the case this year.""Certainly last year when we started developing the car - or basically when we put the car on a diet - that suited Max more,"" Perez said. ""I believe at the moment we are asking for the same things. In the first two races, we've been very close together on (car) balance and asking for similar sort of balance. In that regard, it's probably good for now.""Verstappen reveals effect of illness Verstappen admitted on Thursday that an illness he had in the break between the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian races had affected his performance in Jeddah more than he admitted at the time.""I refused to believe it myself for a long time because at home I was really ill and could barely walk around,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I felt like I was missing a lung. I got to the weekend really believing it was gone because normally when you get sick, two or three days afterwards you're alright, you can just do your work.""But then when I jumped in the car in FP1, even with just one performance lap I felt like I had to recover for two laps to be able to breathe normally.""It definitely affected me throughout the weekend. But this weekend it should be alright.""Pre-season testing schedule & 2023 car launches"
32,,,Arsenal: How Gunners delivered on potential in Champions League,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65120035,"Jonas Eidevall has ended Arsenal's 10-year-wait to reach the Champions League last fourIt was not that long ago that Arsenal were being written off as contenders this season after suffering an injury crisis.What a difference a few weeks make; now they are firmly in the hunt to win three trophies.A stunning first-half display against Bayern Munich on Wednesday saw them overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit and book their place in the Women's Champions League semi-finals for the first time in a decade.It caps an impressive month for the Gunners, who ended a four-year wait for silverware by beating Chelsea in the League Cup final on 5 March.""It's been a long-term goal of mine to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League,"" said manager Jonas Eidevall. ""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect. It doesn't mean it's easy and we can do every time, but if we have that potential wouldn't it be incredible and beautiful to bring that to this competition too?""Football Daily podcast reflecting on Arsenal's Champions League winBuoyed by their north London derby victory over Tottenham at the weekend, Eidevall's side were purring with intensity at the Emirates and blew Bayern away with two brilliantly worked goals.They can now look forward to a European semi-final - and with just a three-point gap to WSL leaders Manchester United with seven games remaining, winning three trophies is not out of the question.""Process is really important and results create belief,"" said Eidevall. ""It means the things you are doing, you are more inclined to do again when you win football matches from it.""This month has given us [the results] and hopefully that creates a lot of belief as well.""Emirates 'a realistic vision' as our homeArsenal manager Jonas Eidevall savoured the victory with his players on the pitchVictory gave Eidevall and his players a ""special"" moment in front of more than 20,000 fans - a record crowd for a women's European game played in England.It was a performance the Swede described as their best game at the larger stadium during his time at the club.""It was special when I came here and we beat Chelsea 3-2 in my first game but that was limited time we had worked here,"" said Eidevall. ""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident. They were unbelievable and thoroughly deserved the win. They won't fear whoever is next.""Who is Lord Sugar's newest business partner?

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

34,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"
35,,,"Yulduz and Fariba Hashimi: Escaping the Taliban, chasing a dream",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/63403027,"Yulduz Hashimi (left), Fariba Hashimi (centre) and fellow Afghan Zehra Rezayee on the podium after the Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan 2022It's a scorching hot June afternoon in the middle of an Italian heatwave. There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."

He took charge of Saudi Arabia in July 2019 and guided them to their second successive World Cup finals, where they shocked eventual champions Argentina in a 2-1 win in Qatar last year.Renard has never managed a women's team and takes charge of a France side ranked fifth in the world.They are seeking to win their first World Cup this summer and the French Football Federation (FFF) will now hope for a return of the players who boycotted the national team under Diacre.France captain Wendie Renard said last month she will not play at the World Cup and criticised her country's football ""system"".The Lyon centre-back was joined in doing so by team-mates Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto, with forward Diani saying the management of the team was the reason behind her decision. In announcing Diacre's exit, the FFF said the situation had become ""irreversible"".SAFF president Yasser Al-Misehal confirmed earlier this week: ""[Renard] has an offer from the French Federation and expressed his desire to take this opportunity.""We were informed four days before the current international window and I received a letter from the French Federation, and consulted with the board of directors and we decided to accept this request.""Following Saudi Arabia's 2-1 friendly loss to Bolivia on Tuesday, Renard said: ""I would like to thank everybody in Saudi for their support during almost four years. ""I think I did the maximum with the team. I can't reach another level so I prefer to be honest with everybody.

""To be honest, we have a lot more respect for each other than people might think. Inside the team, there is a very high level of respect with each other. ""I think we are both mature enough to know what's right and what's wrong and, as long as that keeps being the case, I don't expect anything to change.""The potential for conflict between the two was made clear during the last race in Saudi Arabia, when Verstappen insisted on going for the point for fastest lap when his engineer had said the team was ""not concerned about that"".Perez admitted on Thursday at the start of the Australian Grand Prix weekend that he believed in Jeddah that he was not free to go for fastest lap but insisted that it was ""a bit of miscommunication between my engineer and myself - I don't think there was any more to it. I think the team did a good job to let us race"". However, his comments in Melbourne reflected an inconsistency of messaging at Red Bull. Team principal Christian Horner said after the race in Saudi Arabia that Perez had also tried to go for fastest lap on the final tour of the race but had made a mistake at the first corner and had to abandon the attempt.But Perez said: ""No, I didn't try. I spoke with my engineers and it was all clear. I had a word with Christian after the race and it was all clear. ""It's nothing big. You guys like to create some stories when we're not racing but I think it's all good in the team.""He added: ""I probably regret not having a go at the fastest lap because I thought that was the case. ""But the communication that they'd told me something and told something different to Max… it was just down to us to go out there and do it.""Last year, Perez also started the season strongly, only for the development direction of Red Bull's car - particularly the team's desire to reduce its weight and make its characteristics suit Verstappen's driving preferences - to leave Perez struggling for pace.The Mexican said he believed that would not be the case this year.""Certainly last year when we started developing the car - or basically when we put the car on a diet - that suited Max more,"" Perez said. ""I believe at the moment we are asking for the same things. In the first two races, we've been very close together on (car) balance and asking for similar sort of balance. In that regard, it's probably good for now.""Verstappen reveals effect of illness Verstappen admitted on Thursday that an illness he had in the break between the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian races had affected his performance in Jeddah more than he admitted at the time.""I refused to believe it myself for a long time because at home I was really ill and could barely walk around,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I felt like I was missing a lung. I got to the weekend really believing it was gone because normally when you get sick, two or three days afterwards you're alright, you can just do your work.""But then when I jumped in the car in FP1, even with just one performance lap I felt like I had to recover for two laps to be able to breathe normally.""It definitely affected me throughout the weekend. But this weekend it should be alright.""Pre-season testing schedule & 2023 car launches"

""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect. It doesn't mean it's easy and we can do every time, but if we have that potential wouldn't it be incredible and beautiful to bring that to this competition too?""Football Daily podcast reflecting on Arsenal's Champions League winBuoyed by their north London derby victory over Tottenham at the weekend, Eidevall's side were purring with intensity at the Emirates and blew Bayern away with two brilliantly worked goals.They can now look forward to a European semi-final - and with just a three-point gap to WSL leaders Manchester United with seven games remaining, winning three trophies is not out of the question.""Process is really important and results create belief,"" said Eidevall. ""It means the things you are doing, you are more inclined to do again when you win football matches from it.""This month has given us [the results] and hopefully that creates a lot of belief as well.""Emirates 'a realistic vision' as our homeArsenal manager Jonas Eidevall savoured the victory with his players on the pitchVictory gave Eidevall and his players a ""special"" moment in front of more than 20,000 fans - a record crowd for a women's European game played in England.It was a performance the Swede described as their best game at the larger stadium during his time at the club.""It was special when I came here and we beat Chelsea 3-2 in my first game but that was limited time we had worked here,"" said Eidevall. ""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident.

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

40,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"

There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."

He took charge of Saudi Arabia in July 2019 and guided them to their second successive World Cup finals, where they shocked eventual champions Argentina in a 2-1 win in Qatar last year.Renard has never managed a women's team and takes charge of a France side ranked fifth in the world.They are seeking to win their first World Cup this summer and the French Football Federation (FFF) will now hope for a return of the players who boycotted the national team under Diacre.France captain Wendie Renard said last month she will not play at the World Cup and criticised her country's football ""system"".The Lyon centre-back was joined in doing so by team-mates Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto, with forward Diani saying the management of the team was the reason behind her decision. In announcing Diacre's exit, the FFF said the situation had become ""irreversible"".SAFF president Yasser Al-Misehal confirmed earlier this week: ""[Renard] has an offer from the French Federation and expressed his desire to take this opportunity.""We were informed four days before the current international window and I received a letter from the French Federation, and consulted with the board of directors and we decided to accept this request.""Following Saudi Arabia's 2-1 friendly loss to Bolivia on Tuesday, Renard said: ""I would like to thank everybody in Saudi for their support during almost four years.

""To be honest, we have a lot more respect for each other than people might think. Inside the team, there is a very high level of respect with each other. ""I think we are both mature enough to know what's right and what's wrong and, as long as that keeps being the case, I don't expect anything to change.""The potential for conflict between the two was made clear during the last race in Saudi Arabia, when Verstappen insisted on going for the point for fastest lap when his engineer had said the team was ""not concerned about that"".Perez admitted on Thursday at the start of the Australian Grand Prix weekend that he believed in Jeddah that he was not free to go for fastest lap but insisted that it was ""a bit of miscommunication between my engineer and myself - I don't think there was any more to it. I think the team did a good job to let us race"". However, his comments in Melbourne reflected an inconsistency of messaging at Red Bull. Team principal Christian Horner said after the race in Saudi Arabia that Perez had also tried to go for fastest lap on the final tour of the race but had made a mistake at the first corner and had to abandon the attempt.But Perez said: ""No, I didn't try. I spoke with my engineers and it was all clear. I had a word with Christian after the race and it was all clear. ""It's nothing big. You guys like to create some stories when we're not racing but I think it's all good in the team.""He added: ""I probably regret not having a go at the fastest lap because I thought that was the case. ""But the communication that they'd told me something and told something different to Max… it was just down to us to go out there and do it.""Last year, Perez also started the season strongly, only for the development direction of Red Bull's car - particularly the team's desire to reduce its weight and make its characteristics suit Verstappen's driving preferences - to leave Perez struggling for pace.The Mexican said he believed that would not be the case this year.""Certainly last year when we started developing the car - or basically when we put the car on a diet - that suited Max more,"" Perez said. ""I believe at the moment we are asking for the same things. In the first two races, we've been very close together on (car) balance and asking for similar sort of balance. In that regard, it's probably good for now.""Verstappen reveals effect of illness Verstappen admitted on Thursday that an illness he had in the break between the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian races had affected his performance in Jeddah more than he admitted at the time.""I refused to believe it myself for a long time because at home I was really ill and could barely walk around,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I felt like I was missing a lung. I got to the weekend really believing it was gone because normally when you get sick, two or three days afterwards you're alright, you can just do your work.""But then when I jumped in the car in FP1, even with just one performance lap I felt like I had to recover for two laps to be able to breathe normally.""It definitely affected me throughout the weekend. But this weekend it should be alright.""Pre-season testing schedule & 2023 car launches"
44,,,Arsenal: How Gunners delivered on potential in Champions League,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65120035,"Jonas Eidevall has ended Arsenal's 10-year-wait to reach the Champions League last fourIt was not that long ago that Arsenal were being written off as contenders this season after suffering an injury crisis.What a difference a few weeks make; now they are firmly in the hunt to win three trophies.A stunning first-half display against Bayern Munich on Wednesday saw them overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit and book their place in the Women's Champions League semi-finals for the first time in a decade.It caps an impressive month for the Gunners, who ended a four-year wait for silverware by beating Chelsea in the League Cup final on 5 March.""It's been a long-term goal of mine to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League,"" said manager Jonas Eidevall. ""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect. It doesn't mean it's easy and we can do every time, but if we have that potential wouldn't it be incredible and beautiful to bring that to this competition too?""Football Daily podcast reflecting on Arsenal's Champions League winBuoyed by their north London derby victory over Tottenham at the weekend, Eidevall's side were purring with intensity at the Emirates and blew Bayern away with two brilliantly worked goals.They can now look forward to a European semi-final - and with just a three-point gap to WSL leaders Manchester United with seven games remaining, winning three trophies is not out of the question.""Process is really important and results create belief,"" said Eidevall. ""It means the things you are doing, you are more inclined to do again when you win football matches from it.""This month has given us [the results] and hopefully that creates a lot of belief as well.""Emirates 'a realistic vision' as our homeArsenal manager Jonas Eidevall savoured the victory with his players on the pitchVictory gave Eidevall and his players a ""special"" moment in front of more than 20,000 fans - a record crowd for a women's European game played in England.It was a performance the Swede described as their best game at the larger stadium during his time at the club.""It was special when I came here and we beat Chelsea 3-2 in my first game but that was limited time we had worked here,"" said Eidevall. ""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident.

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

46,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"
47,,,"Yulduz and Fariba Hashimi: Escaping the Taliban, chasing a dream",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/63403027,"Yulduz Hashimi (left), Fariba Hashimi (centre) and fellow Afghan Zehra Rezayee on the podium after the Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan 2022It's a scorching hot June afternoon in the middle of an Italian heatwave. There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."

""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect. It doesn't mean it's easy and we can do every time, but if we have that potential wouldn't it be incredible and beautiful to bring that to this competition too?""Football Daily podcast reflecting on Arsenal's Champions League winBuoyed by their north London derby victory over Tottenham at the weekend, Eidevall's side were purring with intensity at the Emirates and blew Bayern away with two brilliantly worked goals.They can now look forward to a European semi-final - and with just a three-point gap to WSL leaders Manchester United with seven games remaining, winning three trophies is not out of the question.""Process is really important and results create belief,"" said Eidevall. ""It means the things you are doing, you are more inclined to do again when you win football matches from it.""This month has given us [the results] and hopefully that creates a lot of belief as well.""Emirates 'a realistic vision' as our homeArsenal manager Jonas Eidevall savoured the victory with his players on the pitchVictory gave Eidevall and his players a ""special"" moment in front of more than 20,000 fans - a record crowd for a women's European game played in England.It was a performance the Swede described as their best game at the larger stadium during his time at the club.""It was special when I came here and we beat Chelsea 3-2 in my first game but that was limited time we had worked here,"" said Eidevall. ""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident. They were unbelievable and thoroughly deserved the win. They won't fear whoever is next.""Who is Lord Sugar's newest business partner?

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

50,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"

There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."
52,,,Arsenal: How Gunners delivered on potential in Champions League,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65120035,"Jonas Eidevall has ended Arsenal's 10-year-wait to reach the Champions League last fourIt was not that long ago that Arsenal were being written off as contenders this season after suffering an injury crisis.What a difference a few weeks make; now they are firmly in the hunt to win three trophies.A stunning first-half display against Bayern Munich on Wednesday saw them overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit and book their place in the Women's Champions League semi-finals for the first time in a decade.It caps an impressive month for the Gunners, who ended a four-year wait for silverware by beating Chelsea in the League Cup final on 5 March.""It's been a long-term goal of mine to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League,"" said manager Jonas Eidevall. ""It's an incredible achievement that we are so proud of. ""I told the players before the game that our performance in the League Cup final told me we had potential [to win] when we get things perfect. It doesn't mean it's easy and we can do every time, but if we have that potential wouldn't it be incredible and beautiful to bring that to this competition too?""Football Daily podcast reflecting on Arsenal's Champions League winBuoyed by their north London derby victory over Tottenham at the weekend, Eidevall's side were purring with intensity at the Emirates and blew Bayern away with two brilliantly worked goals.They can now look forward to a European semi-final - and with just a three-point gap to WSL leaders Manchester United with seven games remaining, winning three trophies is not out of the question.""Process is really important and results create belief,"" said Eidevall. ""It means the things you are doing, you are more inclined to do again when you win football matches from it.""This month has given us [the results] and hopefully that creates a lot of belief as well.""Emirates 'a realistic vision' as our homeArsenal manager Jonas Eidevall savoured the victory with his players on the pitchVictory gave Eidevall and his players a ""special"" moment in front of more than 20,000 fans - a record crowd for a women's European game played in England.It was a performance the Swede described as their best game at the larger stadium during his time at the club.""It was special when I came here and we beat Chelsea 3-2 in my first game but that was limited time we had worked here,"" said Eidevall. ""This feels like 20 months' combination of work going into a double header against one of the best teams in Europe at the moment. I'm very proud of that.""He said he believed the familiarity of playing at the Emirates this season had played a part in their success, and it was a ""realistic vision"" to make it a permanent home for the women's team in the future.""It's been absolutely fundamental, that without us being able to experience playing here so many times, but also to get supporters here to experience it so many times with us,"" said Eidevall. ""I really hope that it continues to push. I get the sense of belief that we're seeing history getting created very quickly in front of our eyes when I see how the attendances and the culture is here at the Emirates Stadium. ""Five years ago, if someone would have said that Arsenal's long-term plan is to move permanently to Emirates Stadium, people would probably have asked 'how is that going to happen?'""But now I think people understand that might be a realistic vision for the future.""'They won't fear whoever is next'Injured England forward Beth Mead (right) joined in the post-match celebrationsWhat makes Arsenal's recent form even more notable is it has been done without star forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead, who they lost to anterior cruciate ligament injuries before Christmas.After initially struggling for goals, they now seem to have found answers. Striker Stina Blackstenius stepped up at the Emirates, delivering the second goal and impressing with her overall play.""That's a really big turning point for this Arsenal team because previously she had not been doing that. The level of performance she delivered was really impressive,"" said ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live.""What impresses me the most about Arsenal this season is the amount of adversity they have overcome. To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League is huge. ""The more you can get used to this feeling, the more it can drive you on.""Back-to-back European finalists Barcelona remain in the competition, while holders Lyon must come from behind to beat Arsenal's WSL rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Thursday's semi-final.So tough opposition remains - but can Arsenal recreate history and win another historic crown?Former England defender Gilly Flaherty told BBC Radio 5 Live they ""believe they can go the whole way"".She added: ""Eidevall is confident Arsenal can beat anybody.""If they get the gameplan right, they're confident. They were unbelievable and thoroughly deserved the win. They won't fear whoever is next.""Who is Lord Sugar's newest business partner?

""They have proved me wrong a few times now, but they are not the only ones because I don't have many teams who I can rely on, to always be good or bad.""All things considered, I think I'm doing really well but please remember that, if I really were a predictions genius, I would not be working as a pundit - I'd be a billionaire.""Brighton's long 'unbeaten streak' explainedSutton's prediction-making predecessor for the BBC, Mark Lawrenson, once tipped his former club Liverpool to stay undefeated for 159 successive games, between May 2016 and November 2020.There have been no imaginary 'Invincibles' this season, though. In the alternative universe based on Sutton's results, Manchester City went unbeaten for their first 23 games, before he (wrongly) tipped Arsenal to beat them at the Emirates in February.Now it is Brighton who are currently on the longest unbeaten run - Sutton has not backed them to lose since they went to Etihad Stadium in October.Meanwhile, West Ham and Chelsea are two of the teams faring much better in Sutton's table than they are in reality - in contrast to Manchester United, who are doing noticeably worse.""I always think Brighton will score goals, that's why I go with them, while United are definitely one of the teams I have doubted,"" Sutton explained. ""There were spells before the season stopped for the World Cup where I thought they would lose every week, but they improved under Erik ten Hag as the season went on and my predictions have reflected that.""With Chelsea, I'm a former fans' favourite from my prolific spell there, so I've got to keep their supporters happy, haven't I?""Being serious, though, I kept expecting them to get better under Graham Potter, but that never happened. It's the same with the Hammers, who have never got going this season.""I still thought I'd backed Chelsea to lose more often than I have done, but then I don't go back through my previous predictions for each team to check what I said about them in the past, because that doesn't help me get their next results right.""I'm not worried about getting this table spot on because my aim is to get as many scores correct as I can each week and beat my guests.

54,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"
55,,,"Yulduz and Fariba Hashimi: Escaping the Taliban, chasing a dream",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/63403027,"Yulduz Hashimi (left), Fariba Hashimi (centre) and fellow Afghan Zehra Rezayee on the podium after the Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan 2022It's a scorching hot June afternoon in the middle of an Italian heatwave. There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."
56,,,Gheorghe Hagi: Inside a football icon's plan to restore Romania's glory days,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64920773,"Gheorghe Hagi, 58, remains the most celebrated player in Romanian football historyRomania have not qualified for a World Cup since 1998 and have reached the European Championships only twice since 2000, failing to get past the group stage on both occasions. They begin their attempt to qualify for Euro 2024 with matches against Andorra and Belarus this month.Gheorghe Hagi, who illuminated Romania's run to the World Cup quarter-finals of 1994 and is widely regarded as their best player of all time, is on a mission to transform their fortunes.""Hagi for president"" was chanted by hundreds of thousands back home as Romania beat Colombia, hosts USA and Argentina on their way to the World Cup quarter-finals in 1994. Penalty defeat by Sweden followed, but the wave of unprecedented love towards the nation's football hero lost little momentum.Two years later, despite Hagi not running in Romania's 1996 presidential elections, people still voted for him. They wrote his name out by hand, with the midfielder getting a few thousand votes, more than some of the official candidates.Over a 29-year professional career that ended at Galatasaray in 2001, Hagi played for Real Madrid and Barcelona and appeared 124 times for his country, scoring a joint record 35 goals. They called him the 'Maradona of the Carpathians'.  He placed fourth for the Ballon d'Or in 1994 and Pele included him in a 125-strong list of the world's best living players in 2004.Hagi turned to management months after his retirement from professional football. His first job? The Romania national team.For the 'King', as he is known in Romania, it was a rough start. His side lost to Slovenia in the World Cup qualification play-offs and missed out on a place at the tournament for the first time since 1986.When he was playing, Hagi could decide everything on his own through an unexpected shot, a mazy dribble or a keyhole assist.""I had personality, I had good ball control and I was fast,"" Hagi says. ""I grew up with the Netherlands team in the 1970s, with total football. Johan Cruyff was my idol. I wore the number 10 most of the time and I knew what that meant: create a goal or score.""I wore the number 10 shirt for Real Madrid and Barcelona, two of the best teams in the world. My ambition was always to be the best - that was my biggest motivation.""In management, things seemed more difficult for him. Things did not work out so brilliantly at the start - but the picture is different now.Now 58, he is the owner and head coach of Farul Constanța, Romania's current top-flight leaders. After jobs at Galatasaray, Bursaspor and Steaua Bucharest, in 2009 he returned to his hometown of Constanța on the Black Sea coast with a bold ambition.He started an academy from scratch, investing part of his own fortune and borrowing the rest to support the project. More than £10m was injected to fuel his dream: creating a generation that would get Romania in the fight to win the World Cup.Hagi still entertains during training sessions with his dribbling skills, free-kick masterclasses and passing abilities. He is the king in his castle, with young prospects' faces lighting up as he walks past. When he started the academy, more than 200 kids from all around the country joined. About 100 staff were hired. The academy took over a third-tier club, Viitorul Constanța, and quickly won consecutive promotions to the top flight. In 2017 the almost unthinkable happened - Hagi's team won the Romanian title, with cup success following two years later. In 2021 the club merged with the well-supported Farul Constanța, where Hagi's own journey in football began when he was 10 years old.A big part of the money Hagi earned as a player is now invested in his club. Farul are one of the youngest teams in Europe, with the club's philosophy centred around youth development. Recently, Hagi offered a 14-year-old his top-flight debut. Hagi's academy took over third-tier Viitorul Constanta in 2009. Eight years later they won the Romanian titleOver the years, teenagers who have impressed have moved abroad, joining Ajax, Fiorentina, Brighton, and Rangers. Almost half of the most recent Romania squad have a background in Hagi's team, while the percentages in the youth national sides are even more impressive.One of those who rose through the ranks at the academy is Hagi's son, Ianis. The 24-year-old is now at Rangers, after playing for Fiorentina and Genk.""A good player can go out and do his job anywhere,"" Hagi says. ""The league doesn't matter. Ianis won the award for Rangers' best young player before his knee ligament injury (in January 2022), so he adapted fairly well. Bad luck with his injury. But if I never got to play in England, maybe he will - why not?""I had two opportunities to play in the Premier League and I'm sorry I finally missed both. It's a country I like and respect. I'm sure fans would have enjoyed my style.""Tottenham and Newcastle tried to sign Hagi in the 1990s. Cruyff and Barcelona were in the way in 1994. Then Galatasaray tempted him with a big European project close to home two years later.""I loved Kevin Keegan as a kid - he was one of my idols - so I would have loved to play under him at Newcastle,"" Hagi says. ""But when Cruyff calls you in person and asks you to go with him to Barcelona, it's hard to resist. He said I was his favourite number 10.""Then I opted for Galatasaray. They wanted to build a team that would challenge for continental success. Also, they were closer to Romania, and I always had the idea to return home after football.""I wrote a book. I put everything inside about my tactics, my philosophy, about how I see football. You have to start with the basics, do the simple things first, then go step by step towards the more complicated. My motto is: I'm born to win, not just to exist. So I'm trying to apply that in everything I do and I want to inspire those I work with to do the same.""Cruyff is my inspiration. The way he did things was just amazing. I learned so much from him, from his methods and ideas.""Hagi's academy aims to promote at least two players to the first team each season. The manager doesn't care about the age of those he trains. ""I was lucky enough to have good teachers who accelerated my progress. That's what I want to do myself,"" he adds. ""This entire academy is my way of giving something back to football because I always felt indebted.""The academy is built on former farmland outside the coastal town of ConstanțaThe academy lies just outside Constanța, a city of about 300,000 people situated on the Black Sea coast. Before Hagi's project came to this location it was a field where local farmers used to graze their cows and sheep. Hagi was promised a new stadium would be built in Constanța, able to hold 20,000 - four times the capacity of the ground the team currently occupy at his academy. The Romanian government will invest almost £100 million into the new project, which should be ready by 2025.""I returned to Constanța because it's where I was born,"" Hagi says. ""This is my place - Farul made me. ""I am working to create champions. I want to create world champions. I believe in this. I believe in the work I'm doing and in the talent of the Romanian players.""You need to set the biggest goals and believe tirelessly. Otherwise, you aren't going to do much.""  Hagi scored three goals in Romania's run to the last eight at USA 1994, including the winner in the last-16 tie with Argentina"
57,,,"Yulduz and Fariba Hashimi: Escaping the Taliban, chasing a dream",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/63403027,"Yulduz Hashimi (left), Fariba Hashimi (centre) and fellow Afghan Zehra Rezayee on the podium after the Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan 2022It's a scorching hot June afternoon in the middle of an Italian heatwave. There hasn't been any rain for a month. But grey clouds are slowly rolling in and the humidity is rising fast. A storm is brewing. The kind that only happens once a summer here.Two sisters are in the foothills of the Dolomites, about to start a 10km climb, weaving to the top of a small mountain. Three of their team-mates, and best friends, are by their side. It's a beautiful route. There are few cars on the road up and a stunning view over a Veneto village awaits them as a reward. They press on. There are 17 winding bends, numbered at each turn. They are elite cyclists - some of the best from their country. But they're not used to riding around bends, and they're certainly not used to cycling in pouring, driving rain. It's far from the dusty landscape of northern Afghanistan where they come from, where often the rubbly roads are not even suitable to walk on. At the top, they pause to admire the view of their new home. Fat droplets of rain run down off their helmets. It's time to go. They grin at each other as they take off on the descent: ""See you at home!""It had never been easy for the sisters to cycle, even before the return of the Taliban. Fariba and Yulduz Hashimi were born in one of the most remote, conservative provinces in Afghanistan, where it was practically unheard of to see women cycling. In 2017 a local cycle race was put on in their local Faryab province, in the north. The sisters - then aged 14 and 17 - decided they wanted to take part. But there was one small problem. They didn't know how to ride a bike.They borrowed a neighbour's to practice one afternoon. After a few hours, they finally got the hang of it.They had to take part in the race secretly because they hadn't told their family. They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan.

They covered themselves up, wearing big baggy clothing, large headscarves and sunglasses so people didn't recognise them. They even changed their names. They ended up finishing first and second. ""It felt amazing. I felt like a bird who could fly,"" Fariba, now 19, tells BBC Sport.Faryab province, where the sisters come from, borders Turkmenistan in the north of AfghanistanThey carried on, entering as many small races as they could. It became harder to keep it from their family because they kept winning. Their parents soon found out from photos taken by local media.""They were upset at first. They asked me to stop cycling,"" Fariba says. ""But I didn't give up. I secretly continued,"" she smiles.Their parents warned against the dangers, but eventually they were supportive. The sisters faced regular harassment. ""People were abusive. All I wanted to do was win races,"" Yulduz, 22, explains.""There were lots of threats,"" Fariba adds. ""People tried to hit us with their cars or rickshaws. They threw stones at us.""Even their female class-mates at school bullied them for riding bikes. Soon though, they got noticed, and were called up for the national team. ""I will never forget the day,"" Yulduz says. ""I felt on top of the world."" Their careers went steadily uphill from there, until the Taliban's return to power in August 2021. It changed everything, and immediately put their lives in danger. The hard-line Islamist group bans women from playing any sport. But that's not all.Since returning to power, the group have consistently cracked down on women's rights and freedoms.They've banned all girls from going to school, and most recently from attending university - entirely cutting off female access to education. They've banned women from most areas of employment - including humanitarian aid organisations. Women don't have the freedom to dress how they want. The Taliban code of conduct says women must cover themselves entirely, but most women in big cities wear the headscarf. They are not allowed to travel long distances without a male chaperone, and have been barred from going to parks and gyms. Without so many rights, many women have wondered what's left for them.The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated 2.6m Afghans became refugees during 2021 as the Taliban returned to powerFariba and Yulduz - and other female athletes like them - were representative of an Afghanistan which had been making some progress towards gender equality over the two decades since a US-led coalition's overthrow of the old regime. The new version of the country though was not one the Taliban recognised. The sisters knew they had to leave if they had any chance of continuing their careers. So, they contacted Alessandra Cappellotto. The Italian, who won a world road title in 1997, now uses cycling to help women around the world.Her charity Road to Equality had sponsored a race organised in Kabul for International Women's Day in March 2021. The Hashimi sisters had met Cappellotto then.""They asked for help. Their lives were in danger. So it was natural to help them,"" Cappellotto says. She called every contact and organisation she could think of to get them out; from the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations.With her influence, Fariba and Yulduz, as well as three of their team-mates - Nooria Mohammadi, Zahra Rezayee and Arezo Sarwari - got a seat on a flight from Kabul, organised by the Italian government.Leaving Kabul airport was a chaotic, upsetting experience. They had to say goodbye to their families, not knowing when - or if - they'd see them again. ""I never thought I would be a refugee. I never imagined that I'd have to leave my country,"" Fariba says.Cappellotto brought them to a small, hilly town in the Veneto region of northern Italy, close to where she lives. Alessandra Cappellotto (far right) became the first Italian woman to win world road race gold in 1997It's no coincidence that it's a location that's hugely popular with cyclists, with countless picturesque cycling routes.She helped the group settle in their new country, organised a house for them to live in, part-time jobs, and - most importantly - weekly private Italian lessons. Alessandra also crucially set them up with brand-new bikes, a professional coach, and a training schedule. ""Alessandra is an Italian cycling hero,"" Fariba says. ""She's helped us a lot. She's like a mother to us.""The group has formed a close bond with their coach, Maurizio. They affectionately call him the 'Capitano'. Fariba and Yulduz with their coach Maurizio (centre), Alessandra Cappellotto (fifth from left) and team-matesUnder his care, the team have had to work hard. ""We never had a coach in Afghanistan. When I arrived, I felt there was a lot to learn,"" Yulduz says. ""It was a shock. It was like I didn't know anything about cycling."" ""They had a more basic technical level of cycling, yes,"" explains Alessandra. ""But it's true that the level of cycling in Europe and Italy is the best in the world."" It was also an issue of safety. They weren't used to cycling on roads with cars. They had to take a cycling proficiency course - usually taken by children. They joined the Italian cycling team Valcar, taking part in races around Italy such as the UCI World Gravel Championships in nearby Vicenza - where they came 33rd and 39th. In October they took part in their first big race abroad since arriving in Italy. The 2022 Women's Road Championships of Afghanistan was hosted in Aigle, Switzerland, because of the situation in the country. The sisters fought out a thrilling finish in October's national championshipsFariba won the race after an exciting sprint-off against her sister, to become the new Afghan women's road champion. After they crossed the finish line, the sisters embraced in a long, tearful hug. Fariba's win secured a contract with the Israel-Premier Tech-Roland team and she is set to step up to the Women's WorldTour level - the highest level in road cycling - later this year.""I did not expect this in my wildest dreams. I will race for all Afghan women!"" she told media after.Her older sister Yulduz, who got silver, has also won a place on Israel-Premier Tech-Roland's Development team. Zahra Rezayee - their friend and flat-mate - secured the bronze.""I am very happy for them,"" Fazli Ahmad Fazli, Afghan Cycling Federation President said. ""These women are amazing riders and I'm sure that soon they will win in big races for Afghanistan.""Fifty riders took part in the race, many of whom fled Afghanistan in August 2021. They came from across different countries in Europe where they are claiming asylum, as well as Singapore and Canada.The sisters have big dreams. They want to become the first cyclists ever - male or female - to represent Afghanistan at the Olympics. It won't be easy - qualifying for the Olympics is hugely competitive. And Afghanistan may not be there at all. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned the Taliban government that the country could be banned from Paris 2024 unless women and young girls were allowed safe access to sport. If that happens, Afghan refugees could have the option to compete under the IOC Refugee Olympic team instead - like Afghan cyclist Masomah Ali Zada did at Tokyo 2020.But Fariba and Yulduz, who have won Olympic scholarships giving them financial and technical support for their careers, want to represent their homeland - and the flag of its toppled government specifically.""I want to raise the flag of Afghanistan,"" Yulduz says. ""I want my father and mother to see me and feel proud. That would be the biggest dream ever.""""Cycling is a sport where willpower, the desire to work hard and passion count for a lot. And these girls definitely have these things,"" Alessandra tells me.Yulduz (left) and Fariba (centre) holding Italian and Afghanistan flags after their winThey desperately miss home, and become instantly emotional when talking about their families. But too often they're reminded why they left. They have had social media messages from relatives who are members of the Taliban - telling them to cover up in photos they've seen of them racing in international media. ""My friends can't go to school or leave their homes,"" Yulduz says. ""I think, what would have happened to me if I stayed?"" The past year has been a huge culture shock. But Italy, and the community they have become a part of, has welcomed them with open arms. ""When the Taliban came, my dream was dying. But Italy gave me another hope,"" smiles Yulduz. It's a brutal decision to have had to make so young - choosing between your homeland and family, and your career and dreams. These sisters are thankful to have each other to share the highs and lows of such tremendous change. While the Taliban is in charge, returning home as professional athletes isn't an option. In the meantime, the sisters want to prove to everyone, but most of all themselves, that the sacrifice of leaving everything behind was worth it. And they're throwing everything they can into their cycling to do so."
